The directory structure of abICS is given as follows:

  :: 

     - examples
        - standard
            - spinel
                - QE
                - vasp
                - openmx
            - sub-lattice
                - QE
                - vasp
                - openmx
        - expert 
            - ising2D
            - 2D_hardcore
            â€¦
    - make_wheel.sh
    - py_mc
        - pymc.py
        - python module
    - test

``examples/standard`` contains samples that can be run by simple files.
``examples/expert`` contains examples by using python module.

A set of python modules are located in the ``py_mc`` directory.


      
Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make wheel file by typing following command:

``$ ./make_wheel.sh``

2. Install using the created file as follows:

``$ pip install dist/py_mc-\*.whl``

If you want to change the install directry, use 
``--user`` option or ``--prefix = DIRECTORY`` ( ``DIRECTORY`` is the path to the directory where you want to install) option. In the following, the case for using ``--user`` option is shown:
